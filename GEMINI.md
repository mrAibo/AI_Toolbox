# AI Toolbox Protocol (Gemini CLI) -- Tier: Basic

> **Tier Note:** Gemini CLI is a Basic-Tier client. Hooks are not available.
> All safety rules below are **soft reminders**, not enforced guardrails.

This project uses the **AI Toolbox** workflow framework. Read this file carefully at the start of every session.

## Session Guidelines (Soft Reminders)

1. **BOOT:** Read `.agent/memory/current-task.md` to understand the current task state before starting.
2. **SAFETY:** Prefer safe, reversible operations. Avoid destructive commands without explicit user confirmation.
3. **HANDOVER:** Update `.agent/memory/session-handover.md` before finishing your session.

## 1. Project Overview & Purpose
* **Primary Goal:** [Describe your project's main purpose here]
* **Workflow Standard:** This project adheres to the AI Toolbox development lifecycle.

## 2. Core Technologies & Stack
* **Workflow Engine:** AI Toolbox (AGENT.md)
* **Task Tracker:** Beads (bd)
* **Execution Wrapper:** RTK (Token-Safe Execution)
* **Languages/Frameworks:** [List your project's languages here, e.g. TypeScript, Python]

## 3. Architectural Patterns
* **Memory Management:** Repository-based project memory in `.agent/memory/`.
* **Decision Tracking:** Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `.agent/memory/architecture-decisions.md`.

## 4. Coding Conventions & Style Guide
* **Workflow Rule:** Follow the [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) Boot Sequence.
* **Naming:** [Inferred: Standard kebab-case for files, camelCase for variables]

## 5. Key Files & Entrypoints
* **Main Contract:** [AGENT.md](AGENT.md)
* **Handover Log:** [.agent/memory/session-handover.md](.agent/memory/session-handover.md)
* **Rules:** [.agent/rules/](.agent/rules/)

## 6. Development & Testing Workflow
* **Booting:** Start every session by reading AGENT.md and the memory files listed above.
* **Testing:** Prefer running tests explicitly. Avoid large automated commands if token budgets are a concern.

## 7. Limitations (Basic Tier)
* No hook automation -- sync and handover must be done manually.
* No multi-agent support.
* Safety rules are recommendations only, not enforced by the toolchain.

Refer to [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) for the full operational contract.
